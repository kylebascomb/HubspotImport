# HubspotImport
Quick program to format an excel sheet to be able to import into Hubspot

Take the excel sheet holding your whole database that was exported from Hubspot. Rename it to database.xlsx
Take the sheet you would like to import and rename it to reference.xlsx

The program will cross-reference the lists and remove any duplicates. It uses the domain name as the unique ID.
